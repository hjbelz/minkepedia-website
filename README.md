Build scripts for minkepedia.org
================================

This project builds the static part of minkepedia.org. The build script is based on Apache Ant with some dependencies on Ruby Gems for Mustache and LESS integration.

Minkepedia is a fun social way to create overviews of fast moving fields of knowledge. Hosted in the cloud and optimized for mobile devices, it provides easy access to complex topics from virtually everywhere. See http://www.minkepedia.org for details.
